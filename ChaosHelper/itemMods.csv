# put the affix in Column A and the tags you want it to have in following columns.
#
# tags can have multipliers
# for example; the added strength entry might be:
#
# +1 to Strength; AddStr; MaxLife*0.5
#
# so if an item has a "+23 to Strength" mod;
# then the AddStr tag will get 23 points and the MaxLife tag will get 11.5 points
# (this tool doesn't round down like the game would)
#
# a multiplier of zero means to count the mod as 1 no matter the value
# having no tag is interpreted as Junk*0
#
# mods are checked in order, so if there are duplicates in this file, only the first will match
